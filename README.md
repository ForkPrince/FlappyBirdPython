# Flappy Bird with Python

Here is Flappy Bird Python version.

## Help

If the game doesn't work, there are two commons errors that you can fix.
1. Check if there is any syntax error when defining each function. Sometimes, that is the reason why the program doesn't work.
2. Finally, if nothing is working, try to use a good IDE, like Pycharm or VSC.

## Setup

1. Download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Download the github then extract it.
4. Open cmd.
5. Use `cd [directory]` to go to the directory that the game is in.
6. Do `pip install pygame`.
7. Finaly, do `python flappy.py` and the game will run!

# Enjoy the game!
