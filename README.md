# Flappy Bird with Python

Here is Flappy Bird Python version. If the game doesn't work, there are three commons errors that you can fix:

1. Check if there is any syntax error when defining each function. Sometimes, that is the reason why the program doesn't work.
2. Finally, if nothing is working, try to use a good IDE, like Pycharm or VSC.
Don't forget to set the max FPS in the last line!

## Setup

1. Download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Extract it.
4. Open cmd.
5. Use `cd [directory]` to go to the directory that the game is in.
6. Do `pip install pygame`
7. Finaly, do `python flappy.py` and the game will run!

# Enjoy the game!
