# FlappyBirdPython
If there is any problem with the game not launching, check the README file. Enjoy the game :)
Here is Flappy Bird Python version. If the game doesn't work, there are three commons errors that you can fix: 
1. Check the names of each files and replace them by their actual names. 
Ex: In line 85, game_font = pygame.font.Font('Downloads/Flappy Bird File 2/FlappyBird_Python-master/04B_19.ttf',40), the text file is in FlappyBird_Python-master. 
If yours is different, you can change it by using the name of your file. 
2. Check if there is any syntax error when defining each function. Sometimes, that is the reason why the program doesn't work. 
3. Finally, if nothing is working, try to use a good IDE, like Pycharm or VSC. 
# Don't forget to set the max FPS in the last line!
Enjoy the game!
